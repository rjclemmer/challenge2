# Challenge 2

I have created a site that an employer can view a portfolio of work samples. The links and images respond to interaction. Links in the navigation bar take users to different sections of the site. The site also has a responsive layout that adapts to a viewport.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them


WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section


WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications


WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others


WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application


WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
